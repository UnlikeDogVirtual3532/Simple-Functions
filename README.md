Adds an alternative to /function called /call. 
It makes manually calling functions more user friendly by eliminating the NBT like style and converting it to more vanilla syntax.


```
/call commands:warn players Steve text "You have been warned"
```
1.20.1 does not support arguments (I think???). So there is no reason to use it until other features are released.
